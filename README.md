## ERC20_token_transfer

After creating an ERC20 token on Ethereum blockchain, I found out that MetaMask does not have provide a way to transfer tokens from/to Ethereum address.

I decided to create a simple interface connected to MetaMask that allows users to directly transfer a ERC20 token to any Ethereum Address.

I created this interface using React.js. The design is fully inspired by the ledger hardware wallet interface.

The smart contract allow the creator of minting new tokens but there is a maximum supply that cannot be exceed. The token can also be burn by the creator.

I launched the ERC20 token on the Ethereum mainnet, so it can be transfered to real Ethereum addresses that have real value.
